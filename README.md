# The Quest of Timmy

This is a text-based adventure game where you will die. A lot. But don't let that discourage you. The game is designed to be a humorous and satirical take on the typical text-based adventure game. Each time you die, you will be given a new opportunity to continue the game, but with a twist.

The game is written in JavaScript and uses a simple state machine to keep track of the game state. The game is rendered using HTML and CSS.

The game is still in development, and there are many features that I would like to add in the future. These include:

* More scenarios to play through
* More items to collect and use
* More NPCs to interact with
* A scoring system to keep track of how well you are doing
* A high score list to compare yourself to others
* A way to save and load your game state
* A way to customize your game experience

I hope you enjoy playing The Quest of Timmy! Let me know if you have any suggestions or feedback.
